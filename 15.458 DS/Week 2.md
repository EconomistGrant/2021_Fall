# Introduction to Predictive Analytics and Data Architecture

# Recap index?
weighted acerage of basket of stocks
Derivation: P6
Divisor: changes to make index smooth

# Predictive Analytics & Statistical Arbitrage
observe patterns that we think normal, can be used to predict future
quantitative trading sstrategy: efficient market hypothesis, paradoxical, if information properly anticipated

# A trading strategy
weight = negative of excess return
$$w_i(t) = -c(R_i(t) - \bar{R})$$
$$\pi(t) = \sum_{i=1}^N w_i(t-1)R_i(t)$$
$$R(t) = \frac{P_t}{P_t - P_{t-1}}$$

# Backtest
numerical simulation of a trading strategy or algorithm 
using historical data

theory vs reality vs simulation

# Data architecture and data modeling
entities and relationships?
how do we represent, store, and analyze multivariate data

# Data Modelling
