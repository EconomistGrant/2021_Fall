# Accruals and accounting quality
quality cannot be taken for granted
characteristic of high quality financial statements:
1. fair, complete representation of current econ performances, financial positions, and risk
2. provide relevant information to forecast the future

public company CFOs believe 20% intentionally misrepresent earnings (legal)
private: 30%

magnitute: 10% off (earnings misrepresentation)

ways to spot:
1. earnings != cash flows
2. deviate from industry norm

# Accural reversal:
net income increases when companies build up positive accruals, but they reverse over time pull income dowm

by nature, accounting cant "create" thinsg but could only move `    over time

# Measure
Total accruals = net income - cash flow from operations
decompose into working capital and non working capital

working capital: small, variable
non-working: large, steady, easy to detect somethingh fishy

# Clorox
accruals = net earnings - net cash from operations = -607
being conservative than just using cash

from cash flow reports
working capital accruals: receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses, account payables, income tax prepaid/payable

if you buy inventory on credit: 
inventory becomes cost of goods sold, net income going down, cash won't be affected yet
so you add in back to casamhh from operations
[add any increase in A/P]

if you buy inventory on cash, no result in net income, but decrease cash
so ro prepare cash statement: [substract any increase in inventory]

**can we say generally do the same direction in liability but do the opposite in asset?**

because of depreciation: net income decreases, add it back in cash statement (again, opposite in asset)

# Ratio
accrual ratio = net income - (cash from operations + cash from investing) / (Average Total Assets)
CFO Level 2 definition

for financing: since both definition (cash & accounting) are the same

# Alert
you could lie about cash flows as well!

# Accrual red flag example
iRobot Case Study from Zion Research Group

# "Cookie Jar Reserves"
reserve for sales returns, allowances, discounts & incentives

allowances for doubtful accounts measures prospect of invoices to customers going uncollected
- allowance for doubtful accounts / accounts receivable, gross

unearned revenue
- discretion(gym?iphone?)
- unearned revenue turnover = sales / average unearned revenue
- days unearned revenue = 365 days  / turnover

reserve for warranty liability
addition to reserve for warranty liability  / sales

deferred tax asset allowance
- like tax credit with tax authorities@

depreciation

LIFO -> low-cost inventory (old) at the end of the "jar" -> liquidation will boost income statements

# Enron
issue debt => inflow as financing
build plants => outflow as investing
sell plants as "trading asset for a trading firm" => inflow as operation
