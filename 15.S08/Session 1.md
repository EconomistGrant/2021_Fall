# Working with Text
1s ticks * R3000 = 200GB
Company fundamentals are structured
working with text provides oppurtunities

NLP is new and moves quickly

NLP is hard: ambuiguity in text
auto-antonym: sancion, oversight

# Machine learning
gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
NLP is rapidly changing field

all the useful things you can do with text to solve problems

# Course Progressions
1. ML techniques
   OLS -> Random Forests -> DNN
2. represent text: contextualized embeddings
   simple: count words
   contextualized embeddings
3. NLP problems we can solve, binary text to seq2seq
   simple: binary classification
   token-based classification
   anything in, anything out: summarize document; translate; question answering

# NLP Problems in Finance
Data Collection - Classification, speech recognition
Data Enrichment - Entity Tagging, data linking
Data Exploration - general search

# Generator
from current value to next value
```python
def my_gen():
    print("1")
    for i in [1,2,3,4]:
        print("2")
        yield i
```
list too large for memory: don't need to materialize
