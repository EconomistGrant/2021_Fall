Zoetis Inc. (/z≈ç-EH-tis/) is the world's largest producer of medicine and vaccinations for pets and livestock. The company was a subsidiary of Pfizer, the world's largest drug maker, but with Pfizer's spinoff of its 83% interest in the firm it is now a completely independent company. The company directly markets the products in approximately 45 countries, and sells the products in more than 100 countries.

Contemporaneous with the spinoff in June 2013 S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that Zoetis would replace First Horizon National Corporation in the S&P 500 stock market index.


== History ==


=== 1950s to 2000s ===

In the 1950s, Pfizer began research on several drugs,  including oxytetracycline. John McKeen, a chemical engineer, discovered its effective use in livestock. In 1952, the Pfizer Agriculture Division opened a research and development facility in Terre Haute, Indiana, called Vigo. By 1988 the division was renamed Pfizer Animal Health.The acquisition of Norden Laboratories from GlaxoSmithKline in 1995 expanded Pfizer's animal health division into small animal care, including domestic pets. Secondary research and development centres were opened in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in 2003. In the same year, Pfizer acquired Pharmacia Corporation for sixty billion dollars in stock options. Between 2007 and 2011, the company acquired Embrex Inc, Catapult Genetics, Bovigen, Wyeth, Fort Dodge Animal Health, Vetnex Animal Health Ltd, Synbiotics Corporation, Microtek, King Pharmaceuticals, and Alpharma.
