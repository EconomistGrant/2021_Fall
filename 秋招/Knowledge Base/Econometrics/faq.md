# consistency > unbiasedness: why?
generally prefer consistency over unbiaseness since bias may be impossible to avoid, or too much a cost

# type I error == false positive:
positive means you reject null hypothesis, but it is false which means the null hypothesis is correct, so the distribution is say mean zero
u take covid test, its positive(reject the null hypothesis that you dont have covid), but you actually dont have it

# duplicate observations
(X'X)^(-1) X'Y

# Multicollinearity
Detect:
1. X variables correlation
2. VIF
Solve:
1. Stepwise regression, AIC, BIC
2. Regularization
3. Principle Component Analysis
