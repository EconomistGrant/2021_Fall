6. FAQ

## FAQ
### duplicate observations
(X'X)^(-1) X'Y
 
### consistency > unbiasedness: why?
generally prefer consistency over unbiaseness since bias may be impossible to avoid, or too much a cost
### type I error == false positive:
positive means you reject null hypothesis, but it is false which means the null hypothesis is correct, so the distribution is say mean zero
u take covid test, its positive(reject the null hypothesis that you dont have covid), but you actually dont have it
