# Alien knowledge
can I guess what character is coming next? - predictive models
last character, by frequency?
discrete structure, local predictability?
full-grounded meaning, co-occuring features

# Three units
probabilistic models of language
liguistic structure & speaker intuition
meaning & use

# Problems
1. Text Classification
language as input, class as output
2. Machine translation
3. Automatic summarization
4. Generation (generate sentences) from structured data
5. Language as interface: talk to robots
6. language as data: computational social science

# Our toolbox
Probabilistic modeling: assign different probability to ambiguity

representation learning in machine learning
linnguistics, form hypothesis about model behavior, probably does not matter?

# Logistics
prereq: probability, intro ML, algo & discrete math (DP)

# Agenda
914 - 928 classifying and predicting words & sentences
930 - 1007 representing words and sentences
1012 - 1026 linguisitc structures & latent variables
1101-1202 applications

# Preview
1. Unsupervised translation
Rosseta stone
2. Leraning word representations
"vector space"
3. Denoising: word by word translation, reorder words
4. Learning sentence representation
5. Speech recognition
